We have created  a mobile app that allows a constable to quickly and easily check the details of a suspicious vehicle in real time using the dataset present in https://stolenvehicles.co.za/. This database contains information about stolen vehicles, and the goal of the mobile app is to allow the constable to access this information while on patrol, so that they can take appropriate action if a suspicious vehicle is found. To do this, the mobile app communicates with the dataset  through an API (Application Programming Interface) in order to retrieve the necessary information.

## Setting up the project in your local environmentðŸ’»

1. [Fork](https://github.com/mauryakshitij/Smart-Naka/fork) this repository.
2. Clone the **forked** repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/Smart-Naka
cd Smart-Naka
```
3. Finally, run the app:
```
flutter run
```
As we have used API that doesn't contain numbers of Indian vehicles so here are some Examples: CT529663, CA529663.
